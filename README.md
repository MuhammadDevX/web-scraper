This repo contains the code for a webscraper which downloads pdfs (you must ensure that all the links returning from the beatiful soap are of the pdfs).

First you use the .ipynb file to get the links.

After wards in the pdfLinks variable you place the array of links from the output of the last cell in the ipynb.

Then you run your backend using 

npm i 

npm start


afterwards you run the html file by double clicking on it in the file explorer.

Click on the download button and your pdfs will start to download one after the other
